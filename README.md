# Morphology of Galaxies via Convolutional Neural Network

### Abstract:

For this project, we set out to create a Deep Learning Model, specifically a Convoluational Neural Network (CNN), to analyze the morphology classification of galaxies. The goal of this assignment is to act as a introduction to Deep Learning, and Neural Networks. We are expected to present the results of our implementation of the CNN. This includes the algorithm itself, parameter validation, generalization errors, and visualizations. Python, specifically Google's open source **Tensorflow**, is used to create and implement the CNN for this problem. We will give you an overview of our experience playing around with tutorials/examples (Rock-Paper-Scissors) then show the results for the morphology classification of galaxies.
